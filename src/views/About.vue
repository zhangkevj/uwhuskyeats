    <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
    <p>Students are given little options in terms of how they can spend their dining account funds. Current food selections are either overpriced or unsatisfactory.</p>
    <h2>OUR SOLUTION</h2>
    <p>This new dining plan will give more autonomy over what they eat and how they spend their dining account funds.</p>
    <p>Our team proposes a platform that broadens the UW Dining experience to local businesses, thus providing students with more choices for where they can spend their money.</p>
    <p>This platform will also provide students with the chance to make informed spending choices by providing lists of participating vendors and information on their own spending habits.</p>
